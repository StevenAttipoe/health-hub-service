## Health Hub Service
This is a Java SpringBoot project that provides API endpoints for the health hub client application. The project is built using the Spring Framework and provides RESTful endpoints that can be consumed by the React front-end.

One of the key features of our system is the ability to assign patients to doctors for review. This feature ensures that patients receive personalized care and attention from a healthcare professional. Additionally, all endpoints are protected using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that patient data is secure and only accessible to authorized personnel.
